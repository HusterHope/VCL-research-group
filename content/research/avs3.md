title: Audio Video Coding (AVS3)
summary: Initiated by AVS Working Group of China, AVS has become an international standard family for digital audio/video compression and transmission, endorsed by IEEE. AVS-3 is an emerging next-generation video coding standard beyond AVS-2. In the first phase of AVS-3 standardization, numerous efficient tools have been studied and adopted, and the coding performance increases about 20% compared to AVS2, meanwhile, the decoding time decreases substantially. especially for 4K sequences, the coding performance increases nearly 30% compared to HEVC. In one and a half year time, the Profile2 and Profile3 of AVS3 will be drafted, which aims to save the coding bit-rate more than 40% and 60% respectively.
